Bracket notation is very useful because sometimes object properties are not known before runtime or we need to access them in a more dynamic way.

=======
Return the current value of the scannedItem key in the foods object. You can assume that only valid keys will be provided as an argument to checkInventory.



let foods = {
  apples: 25,
  oranges: 32,
  plums: 28,
  bananas: 13,
  grapes: 35,
  strawberries: 27
};

function checkInventory(scannedItem) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return foods[scannedItem] ?? null;
  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(checkInventory("apples"));
