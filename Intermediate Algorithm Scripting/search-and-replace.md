# Intermediate Algorithm Scripting: Search and Replace

Create a search and replace function which accepts 3 arguments.

1. String to search.
1. The term to be searched.
1. What to use as the replacement.

The case on the term to be searched should remain the same after replacement; for example, "Cat" should be replaced with "Bat", not "bat".
