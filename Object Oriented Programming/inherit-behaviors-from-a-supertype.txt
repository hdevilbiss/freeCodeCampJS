# Object Oriented Programming: Inherit Behaviors from a Supertype

In the previous challenge, you created a supertype called Animal that defined behaviors shared by all animals.

You already know one way to create an instance of Animal using the new operator:

`let animal = new Animal();`

There are some disadvantages when using this syntax for inheritance. Here's an alternative approach without those disadvantages:

`let animal = Object.create(Animal.prototype);`

Use Object.create to make two instances of Animal named duck and beagle.


```JavaScript
function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

// Only change code below this line

let duck = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line
let beagle = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line
```
