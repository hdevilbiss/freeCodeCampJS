# Object Oriented Programming: Use Inheritance So You Don't Repeat Yourself

There's a principle in programming called Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY). The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change requires fixing code in multiple places. This usually means more work for programmers and more room for errors.

The eat method is repeated in both Cat and Bear. Edit the code in the spirit of DRY by moving the eat method to the Animal supertype.



```JavaScript
function Cat(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Cat.prototype = {
  constructor: Cat,
};

function Bear(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Bear.prototype = {
  constructor: Bear,
};

function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};
```
