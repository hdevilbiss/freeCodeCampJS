# Thank You

## Inspired By freeCodeCamp

I created this repo, because I want to track my progress with freeCodeCamp, and because I just plain enjoy writing about code. Most of the content is Markdown or Text files, but occasionally, I will throw a [js script](https://github.com/hdevilbiss/freeCodeCampJS/tree/master/js) or [flowchart image](https://github.com/hdevilbiss/freeCodeCampJS/tree/master/images) in the top layer of the project.

### String.slice Flowchart

This graphic was created from my understanding of the Mozilla developer docs on the [String.slice method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice#Syntax).
